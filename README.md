# php-unionplatform
A PHP Client library for the UnionPlatform


### purpose ###

Although it is a unionplatform client, it is not a fully functioning socketserver client.
At this point it assumes that the server accepts every message and does not do any
level of server response checking.

It's purpose is just sending the right message to the server through http or https.
Unionplatform makes use of long polling and expects the connection to stay open
